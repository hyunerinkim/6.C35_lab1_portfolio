        <h2>Proposition:</h2>
        <h2>A decrease in the number of abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020 led to a significant decline in abortion rates in those states.</h2>

                    This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the percentage change in abortion rates (2017-2020) and the percentage change in the number of abortion clinics per state. Each point represents a state. A trendline has been included to highlight the correlation.

                Design Decisions and Rationale:
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use of a Regression Line (-1.5):</strong> The trendline reinforces the perception of a strong relationship between clinic closures and abortion rate declines, subtly implying causation.</li>
                <li><strong>Selective Labeling (-0.5):</strong> Only labeling extreme cases like Missouri and Kentucky guides the viewer’s attention toward supporting examples while downplaying counterexamples.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Coding (-1):</strong> Different colors distinguish state trends, drawing attention to patterns while maintaining an intuitive visual appeal.</li>

            <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>
        
            <figure>
                <img width="800" height="550" src="A4-2.png" alt="Scatter plot showing a negative regression line." />
                <figcaption>
                    This visualization suggests that clinic closures do not lead to higher abortion rates. Each point represents a state. A trendline has been included to highlight the correlation.

                Design Decisions and Rationale:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Changing the Y-axis to Total Number of Clinics Instead of % Change (-1.5)</strong><br>
                    Instead of showing the percentage change in the number of clinics, this graph uses the absolute number of clinics in 2020. This subtly shifts the argument away from whether clinic closures impact abortion rates and instead makes it seem as if states with fewer clinics naturally have lower abortion rates. This can mislead viewers into thinking that the overall availability of clinics is more relevant than recent changes, which is not necessarily true.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Selective Use of a Negative Regression Line (-2)</strong><br>
                    The regression line in this version is negative, suggesting that fewer clinics correlate with lower abortion rates. However, this is highly dependent on which metric is used. In the earlier graph, using % change in clinics resulted in a positive trend. The decision to change the variable allows for a more convenient statistical relationship that supports the argument against the proposition, making it a deceptive but persuasive move.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Exclusion of Certain Key States to Avoid Counterevidence (-1)</strong><br>
                    Some key states with dramatic changes in abortion rates and clinic numbers (such as Kentucky and Oklahoma, which were present in the previous graph) are missing or downplayed here. These outliers previously contributed to a positive regression line, which would weaken the intended argument. By omitting or minimizing their influence, the visualization becomes more aligned with the desired conclusion.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Using a Dashed, Faint Regression Line for Subtlety (-1)</strong><br>
                    Unlike a bold regression line that might invite scrutiny, this graph uses a dashed, less prominent line, which makes it seem more neutral and "objective" while still implying a negative relationship. This subtlety makes the argument appear more data-driven and less explicitly manipulated.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Text and Framing Choices to Suggest Causation (-1.5)</strong><br>
                    The title and axis labels do not explicitly state a causal relationship, but the way they are framed strongly implies it. Instead of neutrally stating "Clinic Availability vs. Abortion Rates," the title directly suggests "Impact of Clinic Closures," which primes the viewer to assume that the visualized trend is causal rather than correlational. This is a misleading but effective rhetorical technique.

            <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
            
            <p>
                The process of designing these two visualizations reinforced how subtle design choices can dramatically change how data is perceived. Some aspects were relatively straightforward—such as deciding which variables to plot and ensuring the visuals were clear—but other choices, particularly around framing and labeling, required careful thought. What surprised me most was how easy it is to shift an argument through selective emphasis, even without altering the underlying data. The choice of a regression line, which in one graph supported the proposition and in another opposed it, was particularly striking as a way to guide interpretation.
                Ethical visualization requires balancing persuasive intent with honest representation of data. I now see “ethical analysis and visualization” as ensuring that design decisions do not mislead the audience into assuming causation when only correlation exists, or into overlooking important nuances in the data. While some persuasive choices, such as using color to enhance readability, are acceptable, others—like selectively removing outliers or changing axes to create misleading trends—cross the line into deception. The boundary between “acceptable” and “misleading” lies in intent: if a choice is made to genuinely clarify data, it is ethical; if it is made to distort perception in favor of an argument, it becomes unethical. Going forward, I will be more critical of visualizations, both those I create and those I encounter, to evaluate their intent and impact.
